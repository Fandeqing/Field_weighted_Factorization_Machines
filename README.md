This is the demo code of the [Product-based Neural Network for User Response Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.00144).

This demo contains a small fraction of iPinYou data as mentioned in this paper.

LR, FM, FNN, CCPM and PNN are all implemented in models.py, based on TensorFlow.

You can train any of the models in main.py.

For more details, please refer to the paper or contact the author.
